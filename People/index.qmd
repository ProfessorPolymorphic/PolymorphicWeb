## Barrie D. Robison

![](Barrie.jpeg) 

I am a Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Idaho, where I study evolution and adaptation using an unusual mixture of model systems. Over the course of my career, I have conducted research on the genetic basis of quantitative traits in Salmonids, behavioral genomics and adaptation to captivity in zebrafish, and the implementation of evolutionary models in video games. I taught Genomics and General Genetics for 15 years, and I now teach various courses in Data Science as part of our new Graduate Certificate in Professional Applications of Data Science.

I am a third year undergraduate computer science major and mathematics minor at the University of Idaho. I have been a software developer with Polymorphic Games since the Fall of 2022. My current project is the [TwinStick](../Games/TwinStick/index.qmd) game, where I am working on the AI that controls the defensive [towers](../Games/TwinStick/Towers.qmd).

## Ava Rummler

![](Ava.jpg){width="40%"}

I'm an MFA Candidate and Instructor of record at the University of Idaho where I practice and teach design. My practice focuses on human interaction through different principles of user experience design and research. My professional experience ranges from App Design to Art Direction and I'm now  UX Designer for [TwinStick](../Games/TwinStick/index.qmd)! Here, I implement my design and research experiences to create accessible screens for TwinStick players to learn about evolution and data science.  You can see how the UI/UX of project TwinStick is coming together [here](../Games/TwinStick/UXUI.qmd)!
