## Barrie D. Robison

![](Barrie.jpeg)
I am a Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Idaho, where I study evolution and adaptation using an unusual mixture of model systems. Over the course of my career, I have conducted research on the genetic basis of quantitative traits in Salmonids, behavioral genomics and adaptation to captivity in zebrafish, and the implementation of evolutionary models in video games. I taught Genomics and General Genetics for 15 years, and I now teach various courses in Data Science as part of our new Graduate Certificate in Professional Applications of Data Science.
