    "text": "The best way to explain the concept is to frame our video games in the context of the “ingredients” of evolution:\n\nVariation\nInheritance\nSelection\nTime\n\nWhen these components are present, it leads to Adaptation.\n\n\nThink about the enemies in the old school video games that I used to play in arcades. Space Invaders, Asteroids, Centipede, Tempest, etc. What kinds of variation can you describe in these enemies? In Space Invaders, you had three types of aliens in each wave, plus the occasional bonus flying saucer. In Centipede and Tempest, you actually had categorically different enemy types that varied in how they looked and in their capabilities. Below you can see a few examples of what I mean:\n\nSpace InvadersCentipedeTempest\n\n\n Enemy variation in Space Invaders includes the shape of each alien type (four types), but also their position in the armada (each type has its own row) and their speed of movement (which is adjusted based on how many remain in each wave). For now, we will ignore the flying saucer that passes across the top of the screen. The game increases in difficulty by having the movement speed of each wave increase. Ironically, the increased movement speed of the aliens within a wave as the population size was reduced was an unintended function of the increased frame rate achieved by having fewer aliens draw calls.\n\n\n Centipede includes enemy types with very different behaviors and abilities. The segmented centipede can split into component parts. Fleas drop vertically, leave a trail of mushrooms, and take two hits to destroy. Spiders move in a diagonal zig zag pattern. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen and turn mushrooms poisonous. Each wave the game difficulty increases by changing the behavior and segment number of the centipede.\n\n\n While not as famous as Space Invaders or Centipede, Tempest was one of my favorite games in the early 80s. The player navigated their ship across various geometric shapes, shooting at different types of enemies with different capabilities. These included player capturing Flippers, lane electrifying Pulsars, and obstacle creating Spikers. So many quarters gone…\n\n\n\nThis variation is a big part of what makes video games exciting. The difficulty in video games is usually increased over time by introducing new variations of enemies, changing the enemies’ capabilities (like speed or fire rate) over time, or increasing the number of enemies. The problem (as we see it) is that these variations are introduced as part of a script that is programmed and balanced by the game developers. Beating the game means memorizing the script.\n\n\n\nThe addition of an inheritance model is the primary differentiator in our games that creates adaptation.\nIn most games, there is no relationship between enemies within a wave or between waves. They are instantiated (spawned) with developer defined traits at a specified rate, location, and time (or level or wave). This is the key difference in the games that our lab creates. In our games, the enemies traits are specified by digital genomes that they pass on to their offspring through a form of reproduction. If the enemy has a speed value of 4, that means that when it reproduces, its offspring inherit that speed value of 4. Most of the games we work on specify about 40 to 80 “genes” in the enemy genome, each of which can influence one or more game traits such as speed, fire rate, morphology, behavior, health, armor, resistances, etc.\n\n\n\nSelection occurs when there is a correlation between a trait (say… hit points or movement behavior) and Fitness. In biological populations, Fitness is usually defined in terms of the number of offspring produced by a given individual. We often measure proxies for fitness in empirical biology that are typically predictive of (or at least correlated with ) Fitness, such as seed set in plants, survivorship, or number of eggs. In our games, we can make explicit linkages between performance and fitness using Fitness Functions.\nFor example, in Darwin’s Demons the enemies accrue Aggression by moving downward on the screen. The closer they get to the bottom, the higher their Aggression score. if they move past the player and off the bottom of the screen, their Aggression score gets an even larger boost. After each wave, the enemies with the highest Aggression score also have the highest probability of mating and producing offspring. Thus, we have created an explicit link in which Aggression is correlated with Fitness (number of offspring). Our games often have more than one of these Fitness Functions. For example, the Protean Swarm in Darwin’s Demons can also increase their mating chance with Accuracy (which measures how often they shoot at the player and how close they came to hitting the player) and Lifetime (which measures how long they last on the screen) .\nIf we turn off the fitness functions, then after each wave the enemies undergo random mating. Adaptive evolution does not occur, but the enemy traits might still evolve randomly because of Random Genetic Drift.\n\n\n\nThe concept of time in video games is often defined in terms of waves or levels. Both of these terms imply a progression toward the game’s goal, along with a corresponding increase in difficulty. In our games, we usually specify time in terms of generations. A wave of enemies begin the game, the player defeats them, and then the next wave is created with Inheritance using a mating function specified as described above. As the generations (waves) proceed, the enemies with traits that are best able to optimize the fitness functions have more offspring, and the population adapts to the game play conditions. Most of these conditions are created by player choices and playstyle, and thus the enemies adapt to the player. Difficulty increases organically and repeated gameplay often creates novel adaptive solutions to the same play style.\n\n\n\n\nWe reasoned that playing these types of games might have implications for STEM education. The success of the player is based on her comprehension and application of principles of evolutionary biology. The parallels to real world examples are numerous, and include the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in microbial pathogens, adaptation of crop pests to chemical and biological control measures, and behavioral adaptation to captivity in domesticated animals.\nAdding biological evolution to video games makes the games better for the game player and facilitates player comprehension of complex concepts that are hard to teach."

    "text": "Instead of pre-programming, scripted enemy behaviors to escalate difficulty, our games use populations of creatures that evolve specifically to beat your strategy. Each creature has its own traits that it can pass onto its offspring. After you beat one wave of creatures, the creatures that were the hardest to beat reproduce and you’ll fight their offspring in the next wave. Evolving traits include features like size, speed, damage, resistances, and behavior. We use real principles of evolutionary biology to create a model that includes all the components of real evolution — variation, inheritance, selection, and time — just operating at a much faster pace. This creates dynamic enemies that adapt to how YOU play the game. We just give evolution the space to work.\nOur studio is based on the University of Idaho campus and populated by undergraduate students. A university setting is the one place where you can find programmers, artists, writers, musicians, marketers, and biologists — everyone you need to make a video game with foundations in evolutionary biology. We hire insanely talented teams of undergraduate students to develop our games. This gives us a team that can think outside the box, and it provides a great student experience. Our employees get to build skills in communication, leadership, and collaboration that they take with them when they graduate, all while honing their skills in their own trade."

    "text": "Infectious Disease, Systems Thinking, and Public Education\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlighted that many people were not sufficiently equipped to understand the complex nature of infectious diseases and the uncertainties involved in managing them. This lack of public understanding made people more vulnerable to misinformation and disinformation, resulting in the formation of misconceptions about infectious diseases and public health. Pandemic mitigation strategies and compliance with public health guidance suffered as a result. Equipping the public to better understand infectious diseases requires integration of multiple complex systems, including pathogen biology, the human immune system, and systems of human behavior that are influenced by economic, social, and environmental factors. Tools that improve domain knowledge, systems thinking skills, scientific reasoning, and data literacy (e.g., simulation, data visualization) could help better prepare the public to grapple with the complexity of infectious disease dynamics.\nComputer simulations with interactive visualizations of dynamic phenomenon are a potentially useful vehicle for presenting infectious diseases as a complex system. This promotes systems thinking, which is the ability to see connections and relationships between different factors and can help people understand how small changes in one area can have large effects on the overall system. Adopting a systems thinking framework can demonstrate dynamic relationships between components of a larger whole (Von Bertalanffy & Sutherland, 1974), multi-level heterogeneity of agents, nonlinear dynamics, stochasticity, and emergence of new patterns (Eckhardt et al., 2020; J. H. Miller & Page, 2009; Pearce & Merletti, 2006; Roux, 2011). Systems thinking is essential in understanding the complex dynamics of infectious disease and can help to promote better decision-making and problem-solving. To meet this need, we created Outbreak Simulator (Table 1), a game-like interactive simulation that uses engaging grade-appropriate scenarios of infectious disease to improve domain knowledge (viruses and infectious diseases), systems thinking (complexity, component relationships, emergent behaviors), and data literacy (interpretation of visualizations and argumentation from evidence)."

    "text": "Simulation Description\n\nMathematical Model of Infectious Disease\nOutbreak Simulator uses a compartment model of disease (Weissman et al., 2020) in which the population is divided into categories (Figure 1): Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), Vaccinated (V), Recovered (R), or Deceased (D). The model estimates the rates of exchange between categories over a given time interval (t) using differential equations. When the model parameters are known and key assumptions are met, the differential equations can estimate the epidemic curve of an outbreak. The two most critical assumptions are that the population is homogeneous and well mixed and is fixed in size. Deterministic and stochastic discrete time (Gillespie, 1976) versions of the models offer simpler but computationally performant (deterministic model) and mathematically rigorous but computationally slower (stochastic model) options to use in different educational contexts. We have pre-parameterized scenarios for influenza (multiple strains) and SARS-CoV-2 (multiple variants) and are creating more for additional diseases including Ebola, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and the common cold. Outbreak Simulator can also be used to model fictional disease systems. For example, many science fiction and horror fiction treatments of zombies are based on fictional viruses (e.g. World War Z, Resident Evil, Walking Dead), and these scenarios could prove to be engaging learning environments for some users(E. T. Lofgren et al., 2016; Smith, 2009).\n\n\n\nGeospatial Representation:\nThe compartment model described above assumes a homogeneous and well mixed population - an assumption that is clearly violated when we consider the geographic scope of many infectious diseases. For example, consider the population of the continental United States. There are many factors within the US population that affect the mixing of individuals, including transportation patterns at the local and national scale. While modern transportation increases the mixing of the US population compared to previous pandemics (such as the 1918 influenza outbreak), we have seen that social distancing and travel restrictions can profoundly affect transmission dynamics at the national scale. There can also be considerable geospatial variation in the parameters of the model itself. For example, contact rate (number of individuals that an infectious individual contacts per time interval t) is likely to vary between urban and rural environments. Even seasonal outbreaks of influenza and the common cold can vary depending on spatial and temporal variation of temperature and host health (E. Lofgren et al., 2007). These spatial effects on the modeling of disease can be important in showing learners how outbreaks might affect their region, and how spatial heterogeneity adds complexity to model predictions. To represent the spatial effects of infectious disease dynamics, our simulation models the population as a gridded set of subpopulations. Outbreak Simulator incorporates also uses spatial data layers (Table 1) to modify the parameters of the disease and movement models for each grid cell. We have installed two movement models – a diffusion model and a gravitation model (Simini et al., 2021). We use these models for commuting scale movements between adjacent grid cells. For longer (national) movement, we use a data layer of the travel rates between the 150 largest airports in the continental US.\n\n\nEmbedded Data Visualizations\nOutbreak Simulator uses interactive visualizations intended to help users understand the dynamics of disease ecology, practice scientific inquiry skills, and build data literacy. Figure 2 is a screen shot of Outbreak Simulator, annotated with letters which indicate system components and different visualizations. INFECTED, EXPOSED, and DECEASED individuals are indicated in area (I) on the map by color. The interactive map (A) can be panned, zoomed, and displayed with different data (satellite with population data overlay shown). Elapsed time, speed controls, help, and settings are accessed with a collapsible panel (B). Display settings such as color and visibility for each model compartment on the map can also be customized (C). Other features include a population health bar (D), buttons for initiating an outbreak, an Interventions menu (E), and an Event Log that describes simulation milestones such as initial outbreak location and timestamps of infection events (F). The intervention option allows the user to test how choices related to public health guidance (such as air travel restrictions, local lockdowns, masking, and vaccination) might impact outbreak dynamics.\n\nData visualizations in Outbreak Simulator are interactive, dynamic, and inter-related. For example, the spatial dynamics of the outbreak can be observed by watching the expansion of red (infected) color across the map (Fig 1 I), by scrolling through the event log (Fig 1 F), or by viewing the epidemic curve of a selected state (Fig 1 G). The dynamic graphs (Fig 1 G and H) are interactive in that each model compartment can be toggled and the scale dynamically adjusted. Hovering over the graph shows the exact values for all model component at the hovered time point (Fig 1 G).\nOutbreak Simulator parameterizes infectious disease dynamics with an interactive mental model. The beginning of each scenario provides grade appropriate information about the disease. The user is then guided through model parameterization using a drag and drop interface and plain language narrative-based scaffolding (Figure 3). Figure 3 shows a scenario in which the model parameters represent the 1918 influenza strain (Chowell et al., 2007). The interface allows the user to change model parameters using sliders or direct numerical input."
