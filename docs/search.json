    "text": "On Getting a GUI Program to Submit Jobs on a Supercomputer\nAfter making the program work on the command line and accept arguments, it was time to create a GUI interface to let people more easily interact with the program and run jobs. The actual GUI program runs in a singularity container with wxLua, a Lua binding to wxWidgets.\n\nThe program has a number of text inputs and will spit out a slurm file like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH -p tiny -a 1-5\n\ncd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR\n\n./OutbreakSimulator --params id=0.5 -opost -Run1-$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID -startat ATL --stop 5 -airports \nAnd then I ran into a problem, how do I submit this file to the job system while running in a container? The container doesn’t have access to the host system’s environment, this is after all kind of the point. So how do we get access to the job system from here?\nOne of the interesting features of singularity is that it automatically binds the user’s home directory to the container’s environment. So the container can read file from the user’s home directory, and the container can write files there as well. This opens up a very nice way to communicate between the two environments.\nThe basic way the communication works is as follows:\n\nThe user open the GUI program using the provided shell script\nThe shell script also opens a seperate program that runs in the background on the host system\nWhen the GUI program needs to do something on the host, it writes to a file somehwere which we’ll call input\nWhen the GUI program is done writing, it creates a file called inputset\nThe program on the host waits for the inputset file to be created, and when it is, will run the contents of input as Lua code using the Lua function dofile\nAfter the code is ran on the host, the program will delete the inputset file to mark that it is ready for new input\n\nIn this way, the GUI program can specify any artbitrary code to run on the host. The only thing it does with this power is access the sbatch and squeue command to execute and read the status of the job queue respectively.\nIn the end, it was quite a simple program to get working. The GUI library is relatively easy to use, and the communication between the host and container wasn’t hard to implement; however, it was a real noodle scratcher to get some pieces of this working."

    "text": "EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS\nThe enemies in this game are slimes of several different types. These types correspond to the different damage types that can be caused by the player’s towers (Lightning, Ice, Fire, etc). Our initial idea is that the slimes of a specific type should be resistant to that type of damage. The average resistance of the whole population should increase over time if the player relies on only one type of tower.\nThe current resistance model is as follows:\nDamage Resistance = (Main.Type)0.6 + (Secondary.Type)0.4\nWhere Main.Type and Secondary.Type = 1 if they match the Damage Type and 0 if they do not.\nOur hypothesis is that resistance of the population will adapt to the damage type of the defense used. If true, this hypothesis predicts that the mean resistance of the population will increase over time, primarily through the proliferation of slimes of a Type that matches the Damage Type.\nWe constructed a simple defense in the center of the playing area, consisting of three lightning towers. The only Fitness Function at this time is related to Path Distance to the Player (the closer they get to the player, the more fitness they acquire)."

The Y axis appears to be messed up because there was one slime in one replicate that died very far away from the player (value of 300). I’ve limited the axis to make the plots more readable. There is also a bug that sets the path distance to 0 in generation 0, and Justin is working on that.\nIn a plot like this, we expect to see that points closer to 0 on the y axis are more opaque and red, indicating that those individuals had more offspring. Looks pretty good in that regard. We also note that there are obviously two groups of slimes - one that dies far away and one that gets pretty close.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(allfiles, aes(x=Wave.Number, y= log10(Player.Distance.Fitness)))+\n  geom_jitter(aes(x=Wave.Number, y= log10(Player.Distance.Fitness), color = offspring_count, alpha = offspring_count))+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~file, ncol = 2)+\n  scale_color_continuous(low=\"blue\", high = \"red\")\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\nWarning: Computation failed in `stat_smooth()`\nCaused by error in `smooth.construct.cr.smooth.spec()`:\n! x has insufficient unique values to support 10 knots: reduce k.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot is the same general concept as the previous one, but I am using the transformed values for fitness. I’ve log transformed because of the distribution created by the transformation (something we’ll have to address in development I think). In this case, points near the top should be more red if the fitness function is working.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(allfiles, aes(x=Path.Distance.To.Player, y = Player.Distance.Fitness))+\n  geom_point(aes(x=Path.Distance.To.Player, y = Player.Distance.Fitness, color = offspring_count),  alpha = 0.5)+\n  facet_wrap(~file, ncol = 2)+\n  scale_color_continuous(low=\"blue\", high = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the relationship between true path distance and transformed values. I think this is going to be a problem. The function creates a weird distribution for fitness values.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(allfiles, aes(x=log10(Path.Distance.To.Player), y = log10(Player.Distance.Fitness)))+\n  geom_point(aes(x=log10(Path.Distance.To.Player), y = log10(Player.Distance.Fitness), color = offspring_count),  alpha = 0.5)+\n  facet_wrap(~file, ncol = 2)+\n  scale_color_continuous(low=\"blue\", high = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the log plot of the two variables, which suggests we might consider using log10(Fitness) during the selection step?\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = FitAvg, aes(x = Generation, y = var.offspring.count.Fitness))+\n    geom_col()+\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n    facet_wrap(~file, ncol = 2) \n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(allfiles, aes(x = as.factor(Wave.Number), y = log10(offspring_count+1))) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill=\"lightblue\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n  facet_wrap(~file, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two plots help us understand the relationship between the fitness function and the TRUE measure of fitness - number of offpring. The first plot shows us the variance in offspring_count for each Generation. High variance indicates that not all individuals have an equal probability of mating, which is indicative that selection is acting on the population.\nThe second plot is a box plot of offspring_count by Generation, which gives us an idea of what the distribution looks like.\nOverall, I’d say these game conditions create selection in the early game, between Generation 1 and 3. The question is, what TRAITS are associated with this variation in Fitness?"

    "text": "SUPER ADVANCED EPIDEMIOLOGY\nReal time R0 calculations.\nR0, also known as the basic reproduction number, is a measure of the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. Calculating R0 from time series values of S (Susceptible), I (Infected), and R (Recovered) can be done using a mathematical model, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model.\nThe SIR model is a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics of infectious diseases. The equations are:\ndS/dt = -β * S * I / N dI/dt = β * S * I / N - γ * I dR/dt = γ * I where:\nS is the number of susceptible individuals I is the number of infected individuals R is the number of recovered individuals N is the total population (N = S + I + R) β (beta) is the transmission rate per contact γ (gamma) is the recovery rate The basic reproduction number R0 is given by the formula:\nR0 = β / γ\nIn order to calculate R0 from time series data of S, I, and R, you’ll need to estimate the values of β and γ. One way to do this is to use curve-fitting techniques to fit the SIR model to your data. Once you have estimates for β and γ, you can calculate R0 using the formula above.\nHere’s an example using R and the deSolve package to fit the SIR model to sample data and estimate R0:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(dflong, aes(x=Time, y= R0))+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Basic Reproduction Rate\",\n    subtitle = \"H1N1 Influenza\",\n    caption = \"Data from a single run of Outbreak Simulator.\",\n    tag = \"Figure 3\",\n    x = \"Time (h)\",\n    y = \"R0\"\n  )+\n   scale_colour_brewer(type = \"seq\", palette = \"Spectral\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, color = \"red\", linetype = 3)+\n  facet_wrap(~Airports)\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(dflong, aes(x=Time, y= Beta))+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  labs(\n    title = \"SIR parameters: Beta\",\n    subtitle = \"H1N1 Influenza\",\n    caption = \"Data from a single run of Outbreak Simulator.\",\n    tag = \"Figure 4\",\n    x = \"Time (h)\",\n    y = \"Parameter Estimate\"\n  )+\n   scale_colour_brewer(type = \"seq\", palette = \"Spectral\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, color = \"red\", linetype = 3)+\n  facet_wrap(~Airports)\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(dflong, aes(x=Time, y= Gamma))+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  labs(\n    title = \"SIR parameters: Gamma\",\n    subtitle = \"H1N1 Influenza\",\n    caption = \"Data from a single run of Outbreak Simulator.\",\n    tag = \"Figure 4\",\n    x = \"Time (h)\",\n    y = \"Parameter Estimate\"\n  )+\n   scale_colour_brewer(type = \"seq\", palette = \"Spectral\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = 3)+\n  facet_wrap(~Airports)\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'"

    "text": "The best way to explain the concept is to frame our video games in the context of the “ingredients” of evolution:\n\nVariation\nInheritance\nSelection\nTime\n\nWhen these components are present, it leads to Adaptation.\n\n\nThink about the enemies in the old school video games that I used to play in arcades. Space Invaders, Asteroids, Centipede, Tempest, etc. What kinds of variation can you describe in these enemies? In Space Invaders, you had three types of aliens in each wave, plus the occasional bonus flying saucer. In Centipede and Tempest, you actually had categorically different enemy types that varied in how they looked and in their capabilities. Below you can see a few examples of what I mean:\n\nSpace InvadersCentipedeTempest\n\n\n Enemy variation in Space Invaders includes the shape of each alien type (four types), but also their position in the armada (each type has its own row) and their speed of movement (which is adjusted based on how many remain in each wave). For now, we will ignore the flying saucer that passes across the top of the screen. The game increases in difficulty by having the movement speed of each wave increase. Ironically, the increased movement speed of the aliens within a wave as the population size was reduced was an unintended function of the increased frame rate achieved by having fewer aliens draw calls.\n\n\n Centipede includes enemy types with very different behaviors and abilities. The segmented centipede can split into component parts. Fleas drop vertically, leave a trail of mushrooms, and take two hits to destroy. Spiders move in a diagonal zig zag pattern. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen and turn mushrooms poisonous. Each wave the game difficulty increases by changing the behavior and segment number of the centipede.\n\n\n While not as famous as Space Invaders or Centipede, Tempest was one of my favorite games in the early 80s. The player navigated their ship across various geometric shapes, shooting at different types of enemies with different capabilities. These included player capturing Flippers, lane electrifying Pulsars, and obstacle creating Spikers. So many quarters gone…\n\n\n\nThis variation is a big part of what makes video games exciting. The difficulty in video games is usually increased over time by introducing new variations of enemies, changing the enemies’ capabilities (like speed or fire rate) over time, or increasing the number of enemies. The problem (as we see it) is that these variations are introduced as part of a script that is programmed and balanced by the game developers. Beating the game means memorizing the script.\n\n\n\nThe addition of an inheritance model is the primary differentiator in our games that creates adaptation.\nIn most games, there is no relationship between enemies within a wave or between waves. They are instantiated (spawned) with developer defined traits at a specified rate, location, and time (or level or wave). This is the key difference in the games that our lab creates. In our games, the enemies traits are specified by digital genomes that they pass on to their offspring through a form of reproduction. If the enemy has a speed value of 4, that means that when it reproduces, its offspring inherit that speed value of 4. Most of the games we work on specify about 40 to 80 “genes” in the enemy genome, each of which can influence one or more game traits such as speed, fire rate, morphology, behavior, health, armor, resistances, etc.\n\n\n\nSelection occurs when there is a correlation between a trait (say… hit points or movement behavior) and Fitness. In biological populations, Fitness is usually defined in terms of the number of offspring produced by a given individual. We often measure proxies for fitness in empirical biology that are typically predictive of (or at least correlated with ) Fitness, such as seed set in plants, survivorship, or number of eggs. In our games, we can make explicit linkages between performance and fitness using Fitness Functions.\nFor example, in Darwin’s Demons the enemies accrue Aggression by moving downward on the screen. The closer they get to the bottom, the higher their Aggression score. if they move past the player and off the bottom of the screen, their Aggression score gets an even larger boost. After each wave, the enemies with the highest Aggression score also have the highest probability of mating and producing offspring. Thus, we have created an explicit link in which Aggression is correlated with Fitness (number of offspring). Our games often have more than one of these Fitness Functions. For example, the Protean Swarm in Darwin’s Demons can also increase their mating chance with Accuracy (which measures how often they shoot at the player and how close they came to hitting the player) and Lifetime (which measures how long they last on the screen) .\nIf we turn off the fitness functions, then after each wave the enemies undergo random mating. Adaptive evolution does not occur, but the enemy traits might still evolve randomly because of Random Genetic Drift.\n\n\n\nThe concept of time in video games is often defined in terms of waves or levels. Both of these terms imply a progression toward the game’s goal, along with a corresponding increase in difficulty. In our games, we usually specify time in terms of generations. A wave of enemies begin the game, the player defeats them, and then the next wave is created with Inheritance using a mating function specified as described above. As the generations (waves) proceed, the enemies with traits that are best able to optimize the fitness functions have more offspring, and the population adapts to the game play conditions. Most of these conditions are created by player choices and playstyle, and thus the enemies adapt to the player. Difficulty increases organically and repeated gameplay often creates novel adaptive solutions to the same play style.\n\n\n\n\nWe reasoned that playing these types of games might have implications for STEM education. The success of the player is based on her comprehension and application of principles of evolutionary biology. The parallels to real world examples are numerous, and include the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in microbial pathogens, adaptation of crop pests to chemical and biological control measures, and behavioral adaptation to captivity in domesticated animals.\nAdding biological evolution to video games makes the games better for the game player and facilitates player comprehension of complex concepts that are hard to teach."

We develop video games, interactive simulations, and visualizations that feature STEM concepts as core mechanics.\nOur main focus is Evolutionary Games that feature enemies that adapt to the player using mathematical models of biological evolution.\nWe have also collaborated with many different researchers to help them represent their model systems as interactive simulations or dynamic visualizations.\n\nEVOLUTIONARY GAMES\nInstead of pre-programming, scripted enemy behaviors to escalate difficulty, our games use populations of creatures that evolve specifically to beat your strategy. Each creature has its own traits that it can pass onto its offspring. After you beat one wave of creatures, the creatures that were the hardest to beat reproduce and you’ll fight their offspring in the next wave. Evolving traits include features like size, speed, damage, resistances, and behavior. We use real principles of evolutionary biology to create a model that includes all the components of real evolution — variation, inheritance, selection, and time — just operating at a much faster pace. This creates dynamic enemies that adapt to how YOU play the game. We just give evolution the space to work.\nLearn more about our games…\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT MODEL\nOur studio is based on the University of Idaho campus and populated by undergraduate students. A university setting is the one place where you can find programmers, artists, writers, musicians, marketers, and biologists — everyone you need to make a video game with foundations in evolutionary biology.

This communicates what different “families” look like in terms of slimes and their offspring.\nVideo\nThe slimes in TwinStick are complex when it comes to their specific traits and fitness. It’s important to categorize the slimes for the player to understand their characteristics. This prototype explores the layout of these categories and how the player could potentially interact with these controls.\nAnother factor of this prototype is the potential graph placement and extended information on each slime in a family. The viewer would be able to get a description of each slime along with some important information on their traits, fitness, and maybe even their placement on the graph provided. Comparing and contrasting each slime is also an effectuve educational tool, so this prototype also explores what that would look like.\nVideo\nAs traits become more official, more styles and information architecture styles can be explored as shown by the more “dark mode” approach. This is an exploration of categorizing every offspring in their “fitness,” but still keeping them all on the same screen because of the parents’ ability to have offspring in different fitness categories. Because this requires multiple slimes to be displayed, a different approach to pedigrees was explored.\nThe traits on the side operate as controls to see each type of graph that the player can access. In this prototype, slimes have a value to each trait that’s displayed on the graph. The trait is highlighted with their prospective graph along with the value displayed under the description of the slime and their spot on the scatter plot.\nVideo\nOn occasions where the player wants to compare slimes with the same trait, they can switch between the slime they’d like to see. Their scatter plot point is highlighted with their prospective point, which changes if the player selects another slime in the pedigree. The values in the slime description box also change to coincide with the slime selected.\nVideo\nExploring more of the graph features, this is a prototype of what it could look like if a player wants to select a point on the scatter plot to see which slime coincides with that point. An image of the slime and their information will appear for the player to see.\nVideo\nIf the player would want to switch between pedigrees, this prototype shows what that would potentially look like.

    "text": "TARGET AUDIENCE\n\nLetting the teacher view student progress (Erik Marsh)\nDrider has a task system where the teacher can assign each student a task to perform. These tasks usually involve catching a certain number of animals to analyze some data (such as the number of ticks on each animal). For a while in the development cycle, players were only aware of their own tasks. In a teaching environment, however, this is far from optimal. The teacher should be aware of each student’s task progress, or else it becomes hard to continue a lesson.\nRecently, I reworked the tasks system to allow for the teacher to see individual student progress. It is not yet implemented into the menu system, but the proof-of-concept is shown in the video. Here, the teacher is able to see task progress for themself and their two students in a centralized, scrollable list. Having this functionality is critical, since a student that is goofing off or is struggling to complete the task may slow down the teacher’s lesson plan. Since the teacher is also an active player of the game, checking in on each student’s progress by walking around the room becomes an interruption, which is why in-game progress monitoring is useful.\nThe logic behind this functionality is quite simple. The existing task system simply “listens” for when players catch animals. If the proper conditions are met (such as the player catching the right animal), task progress increases. This progress is shown on the screen with a progress bar. Usually, the task only listens to the player that is being controlled on the local computer, and ignores the players on the other, remote computers. However, every time the teacher assigns a task, an “extra copy” of the task is put on the teacher’s computer that “listens to” the player that it was assigned to. Thus, the task is aware of that player’s progress, and it can be displayed on screen to the teacher as well.\nVideo"

    "text": "We use image files in Outbreak Simulator to store and display spatial data. We call these files textures because although they’re image files, it isn’t pictures that we’re putting into them.\n\nSimply speaking, a texture file can be thought of as a grid of pixels. In a standard colored image, each pixel has a color defined by three channels: red, green, and blue. Each channel holds a value for that pixel which, in the case of color channels, tells us how much of that color is present in the pixel. We usually think of the value of channel as being a floating-point number between 0 and 1.\nIn addition to having three channels per pixel for color, many textures include a fourth channel that defines the opacity of the pixel, or how see-through it is. Some formats even allow for additional channels which aren’t usually visible if trying to view the texture as an image.\n(Image: Color picker in Unity showing the RGBA channel values for a semi-transparent gold color)\nAlthough image files are most often used for storing pictures, they’re also commonly used in games to store other types of information. We can use the channel values of textures to represent any data in any range. Scaling the value from being between 0 to 1 to being between any arbitrary minimum (min) and maximum (max) is pretty straight-forward: (max – min) • value + min\nThe precision of the value stored in each channel is referred to as bit depth. Most images have a bit depth of 8, which means that there are 256 (2^8) possible values stored per channel per pixel. Some formats allow for higher bit depths. Because the level of precision goes up exponentially as the bit depth gets higher (for example, 16bit gives 65536 possible values), it’s not too unrealistic to create textures that contain amazingly precise data"

Programs like QGIS can interpret this extra information and allow us to change the scale and reference coordinate system, if necessary, so that we can use it in our simulation.\nThe coordinate reference system that we use is.

    "text": "Infectious Disease, Systems Thinking, and Public Education\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlighted that many people were not sufficiently equipped to understand the complex nature of infectious diseases and the uncertainties involved in managing them. This lack of public understanding made people more vulnerable to misinformation and disinformation, resulting in the formation of misconceptions about infectious diseases and public health. Pandemic mitigation strategies and compliance with public health guidance suffered as a result. Equipping the public to better understand infectious diseases requires integration of multiple complex systems, including pathogen biology, the human immune system, and systems of human behavior that are influenced by economic, social, and environmental factors. Tools that improve domain knowledge, systems thinking skills, scientific reasoning, and data literacy (e.g., simulation, data visualization) could help better prepare the public to grapple with the complexity of infectious disease dynamics.\nComputer simulations with interactive visualizations of dynamic phenomenon are a potentially useful vehicle for presenting infectious diseases as a complex system. This promotes systems thinking, which is the ability to see connections and relationships between different factors and can help people understand how small changes in one area can have large effects on the overall system. Adopting a systems thinking framework can demonstrate dynamic relationships between components of a larger whole (Von Bertalanffy & Sutherland, 1974), multi-level heterogeneity of agents, nonlinear dynamics, stochasticity, and emergence of new patterns (Eckhardt et al., 2020; J. H. Miller & Page, 2009; Pearce & Merletti, 2006; Roux, 2011). Systems thinking is essential in understanding the complex dynamics of infectious disease and can help to promote better decision-making and problem-solving. To meet this need, we created Outbreak Simulator (Table 1), a game-like interactive simulation that uses engaging grade-appropriate scenarios of infectious disease to improve domain knowledge (viruses and infectious diseases), systems thinking (complexity, component relationships, emergent behaviors), and data literacy (interpretation of visualizations and argumentation from evidence)."

    "text": "Simulation Description\n\nMathematical Model of Infectious Disease\nOutbreak Simulator uses a compartment model of disease (Weissman et al., 2020) in which the population is divided into categories (Figure 1): Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), Vaccinated (V), Recovered (R), or Deceased (D). The model estimates the rates of exchange between categories over a given time interval (t) using differential equations. When the model parameters are known and key assumptions are met, the differential equations can estimate the epidemic curve of an outbreak. The two most critical assumptions are that the population is homogeneous and well mixed and is fixed in size. Deterministic and stochastic discrete time (Gillespie, 1976) versions of the models offer simpler but computationally performant (deterministic model) and mathematically rigorous but computationally slower (stochastic model) options to use in different educational contexts. We have pre-parameterized scenarios for influenza (multiple strains) and SARS-CoV-2 (multiple variants) and are creating more for additional diseases including Ebola, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and the common cold. Outbreak Simulator can also be used to model fictional disease systems. For example, many science fiction and horror fiction treatments of zombies are based on fictional viruses (e.g. World War Z, Resident Evil, Walking Dead), and these scenarios could prove to be engaging learning environments for some users(E. T. Lofgren et al., 2016; Smith, 2009).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeospatial Representation:\nThe compartment model described above assumes a homogeneous and well mixed population - an assumption that is clearly violated when we consider the geographic scope of many infectious diseases. For example, consider the population of the continental United States. There are many factors within the US population that affect the mixing of individuals, including transportation patterns at the local and national scale. While modern transportation increases the mixing of the US population compared to previous pandemics (such as the 1918 influenza outbreak), we have seen that social distancing and travel restrictions can profoundly affect transmission dynamics at the national scale. There can also be considerable geospatial variation in the parameters of the model itself. For example, contact rate (number of individuals that an infectious individual contacts per time interval t) is likely to vary between urban and rural environments. Even seasonal outbreaks of influenza and the common cold can vary depending on spatial and temporal variation of temperature and host health (E. Lofgren et al., 2007). These spatial effects on the modeling of disease can be important in showing learners how outbreaks might affect their region, and how spatial heterogeneity adds complexity to model predictions. To represent the spatial effects of infectious disease dynamics, our simulation models the population as a gridded set of subpopulations. Outbreak Simulator incorporates also uses spatial data layers (Table 1) to modify the parameters of the disease and movement models for each grid cell. We have installed two movement models – a diffusion model and a gravitation model (Simini et al., 2021). We use these models for commuting scale movements between adjacent grid cells. For longer (national) movement, we use a data layer of the travel rates between the 150 largest airports in the continental US.\n\n\nEmbedded Data Visualizations\nOutbreak Simulator uses interactive visualizations intended to help users understand the dynamics of disease ecology, practice scientific inquiry skills, and build data literacy. Figure 2 is a screen shot of Outbreak Simulator, annotated with letters which indicate system components and different visualizations. INFECTED, EXPOSED, and DECEASED individuals are indicated in area (I) on the map by color. The interactive map (A) can be panned, zoomed, and displayed with different data (satellite with population data overlay shown). Elapsed time, speed controls, help, and settings are accessed with a collapsible panel (B). Display settings such as color and visibility for each model compartment on the map can also be customized (C). Other features include a population health bar (D), buttons for initiating an outbreak, an Interventions menu (E), and an Event Log that describes simulation milestones such as initial outbreak location and timestamps of infection events (F). The intervention option allows the user to test how choices related to public health guidance (such as air travel restrictions, local lockdowns, masking, and vaccination) might impact outbreak dynamics.\n\nData visualizations in Outbreak Simulator are interactive, dynamic, and inter-related. For example, the spatial dynamics of the outbreak can be observed by watching the expansion of red (infected) color across the map (Fig 1 I), by scrolling through the event log (Fig 1 F), or by viewing the epidemic curve of a selected state (Fig 1 G). The dynamic graphs (Fig 1 G and H) are interactive in that each model compartment can be toggled and the scale dynamically adjusted. Hovering over the graph shows the exact values for all model component at the hovered time point (Fig 1 G).\nOutbreak Simulator parameterizes infectious disease dynamics with an interactive mental model. The beginning of each scenario provides grade appropriate information about the disease. The user is then guided through model parameterization using a drag and drop interface and plain language narrative-based scaffolding (Figure 3). Figure 3 shows a scenario in which the model parameters represent the 1918 influenza strain (Chowell et al., 2007). The interface allows the user to change model parameters using sliders or direct numerical input."

    "text": "The compartment model described here assumes a homogeneous and well mixed population - an assumption that is clearly violated when we consider the geographic scope of many infectious diseases. For example, consider the population of the continental United States. There are many factors within the US population that affect the mixing of individuals, especially transportation patterns at the local and national scale. While modern transportation increases the mixing of the US population compared to previous pandemics (such as the 1918 influenza outbreak), interventions such as social distancing and travel restrictions can profoundly affect transmission dynamics at the national scale.\nThere can also be considerable geospatial variation in the parameters of the model itself. For example, contact rate (number of individuals that an infectious individual contacts per time interval t) is likely to vary between urban and rural environments. Even seasonal outbreaks of influenza and the common cold can vary depending on spatial and temporal variation of temperature and host health (E. Lofgren et al., 2007). These spatial effects on the modeling of disease can be important in showing learners how outbreaks might affect their region, and how spatial heterogeneity adds complexity to model predictions.\nTo represent the spatial effects of infectious disease dynamics, our simulation models the population as a gridded set of subpopulations. Outbreak Simulator also uses spatial data layers to modify the parameters of the disease and movement models for each grid cell."
